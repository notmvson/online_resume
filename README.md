<h2 id="about">About the Project</h2>
<p> The website link to this project can be found here. The aim of this project was to practice all of my CSS3 and HTML5 knowledge, and attempt to learn new features on the way. This is my first real attempt at front-end development, and I hope to add JavaScript in the future.</p>
<p>This project is intended to be the culmination of knowledge through my first two quarters back in school pursuing a Bachelor's in Software Development at Bellevue College.</p>

<h2 id="builtWith">Built With</h2>
<p>This project was built using the following technologies and languages</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML5</li>
  <li>CSS3</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="futureFeatures">Future Features</h2>
<p>In the future, I am considering creating the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Night Mode - I want to allow the user to be able to toggle night and day mode, making it more readable.</li>
  <li>Mobile Friendly - I would like my website to be readable on a mobile phone screen.</li>
  <li>Screen Size - I want the website to fit correctly with any screen size, and able to change layout if the screen is minimised.</li>
  <li>Incorporate JavaScript - I would like to add more functionality to the project by integrating the JavaScript DOM.</li>
</ul>
